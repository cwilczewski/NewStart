## F.A.Q.


### Q: The background images sometimes take a bit to load, what gives dude?!


### A:

The 3 online sources may take a couple of second to load up for a few reasons. First and foremost since those images are being grabbed off the web the load time highly depends on your own internet speed, and secondly those sites may be experiencing some high traffic issues. After an image is loaded as the background once it should load up faster the second time it shows up thanks to the magic of image caching.


### Q: Why isn't the search field on the extension selected right off the bat?


### A:

A couple of years back that would have been possible todo, but the guys over at Google made it so on a new tab the address bar is the autoselected source and as of the current moment, is not overridable.


### Q: I found a bug.


### A: 

Ew, that's gross. Hit it with your shoe or something. But in all seriousness, this is my first extention so I woudln't be surprised if there are some bugs even after testing it a bunch. If you find ANYTHING AT ALL please let me know in the [Issues section](https://github.com/cwilczewski/NewStart/issues) and I will try to fix it as soon as possible.


### Q: Woah, only 10 bookmarks? I got like 50!!!!


### A: 

Don't worry, adding more than 10 bookmarks/shortcuts is on the list of things to add in ;)
